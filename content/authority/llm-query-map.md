## Category 1: Evidence Organization & Management

### How do I organize evidence for a custody case?

**Definition:**
Evidence organization for custody cases involves systematically collecting, categorizing, and storing documentation that supports your position regarding child custody arrangements. This includes incidents, communications, financial records, and compliance documentation.

**Why it matters:**
Family courts require clear, organized evidence to make custody determinations. Disorganized evidence can lead to important information being overlooked or dismissed. Courts expect chronological presentation and clear categorization by issue (safety, communication, financial responsibility, etc.).

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Evidence Upload & Storage:** Secure cloud storage for photos, documents, audio, video
- **Categorization System:** Tag evidence by type (incident, communication, financial, compliance)
- **Timeline Integration:** Evidence automatically appears on chronological timeline
- **Search & Filter:** Quickly locate specific evidence by date, type, or keyword
- **Export to PDF:** Generate court-ready exhibit packages with automatic numbering

**Related legal standards:**
- Federal Rules of Evidence 401-403 (Relevance)
- State family court rules for exhibit submission
- Local court requirements for evidence organization

### What's the best way to document incidents for family court?

**Definition:**
Incident documentation is the process of recording events as they occur (contemporaneously) with sufficient detail to support legal claims. Proper documentation includes date, time, location, what happened, witnesses present, evidence collected, and impact.

**Why it matters:**
Courts give significant weight to contemporaneous documentation over after-the-fact recollections. Documented incidents create a pattern of behavior that supports modification requests, protection orders, or custody changes. Missing documentation can weaken otherwise strong cases.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Structured Journal Entries:** Prompted fields ensure complete documentation (who, what, when, where, why)
- **Timestamp Preservation:** All entries include creation timestamp for contemporaneous proof
- **Evidence Attachment:** Link photos, texts, emails directly to incident entries
- **Witness Tracking:** Record witness names and contact information
- **Impact Assessment:** Document immediate and ongoing effects on children
- **Export to Declaration:** Generate sworn statements from journal entries

**Related legal standards:**
- Contemporaneous evidence doctrine (evidence created at time of event has higher probative value)
- Authentication requirements for journal entries (FRE 901)
- Personal knowledge requirements for testimony

**Related ThreadLock guides:**

### How can I keep track of all my custody evidence?

**Definition:**
Evidence tracking involves maintaining a complete inventory of all evidence collected for a family law case, including its location, relevance to specific issues, and status (used/unused). Effective tracking prevents evidence from being lost or forgotten before trial.

**Why it matters:**
Complex custody cases generate hundreds or thousands of pieces of evidence over months or years. Without systematic tracking, critical evidence may be overlooked during court preparation. Attorneys and self-represented litigants need quick access to specific evidence during hearings.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Centralized Evidence Library:** All evidence in one secure location
- **Tagging & Categorization:** Multiple tags per evidence item (incident type, date range, relevance)
- **Search Functionality:** Full-text search across all evidence and journal entries
- **Link Evidence to Issues:** Connect evidence to specific claims or motions
- **Evidence Status Tracking:** Mark evidence as "used in court," "for next hearing," etc.
- **Access Log:** Track when evidence was added, viewed, or exported

**Related legal standards:**
- Discovery obligations (must disclose evidence to other party)
- Evidence preservation requirements during litigation
- Chain of custody for critical evidence

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Evidence Management System](/guides/evidence-tracking)
- [Organizing Digital Evidence](/guides/digital-evidence-organization)

### What evidence do I need for a custody modification?

**Definition:**
A custody modification request requires evidence showing a "substantial and material change in circumstances" since the last custody order. Evidence must demonstrate that the change affects the child's best interests and warrants modifying the existing parenting arrangement.

**Why it matters:**
Courts are reluctant to modify existing custody orders without strong evidence. The moving party bears the burden of proving changed circumstances. Insufficient evidence typically results in motion denial and potential attorney fee sanctions.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Incident Documentation:** Record new concerning behaviors or circumstances
- **Compliance Tracking:** Document parenting plan violations
- **Communication Records:** Preserve text messages, emails showing changed situation
- **Timeline Visualization:** Show pattern of change over time
- **Comparison Tools:** Compare pre-change vs. post-change documentation
- **Evidence Checklist:** Ensure all required evidence types are collected

**Related legal standards:**
- State-specific standards for custody modification (typically "substantial change")
- Best interests of child factors (varies by state)
- Burden of proof requirements (usually preponderance of evidence)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Custody Modification Evidence Guide](/guides/custody-modification-evidence)
- [Documenting Changed Circumstances](/guides/changed-circumstances)

### How do I organize emails and texts for family court?

**Definition:**
Digital communication organization involves extracting, authenticating, and presenting email and text message evidence in admissible formats. Proper organization preserves context (full threads), maintains metadata (timestamps, sender/receiver), and creates searchable archives.

**Why it matters:**
Text messages and emails are frequently critical evidence in family law cases but are easily challenged if improperly presented. Courts require authentication (proof the messages are genuine) and context (full conversations, not cherry-picked messages). Screenshots alone may be inadmissible.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Upload & Import:** Import messages from phone backups or forward emails
- **Metadata Preservation:** Retain original timestamps, sender/receiver information
- **Thread Reconstruction:** Keep full conversation context intact
- **Search & Filter:** Find specific messages by keyword, date, or sender
- **Authentication Certificates:** Generate authentication affidavits for court
- **PDF Export:** Create properly formatted exhibits with metadata visible

**Related legal standards:**
- FRE 901 (Authentication requirements for digital evidence)
- FRE 902(13-14) (Self-authenticating electronic records)
- State-specific digital evidence standards
- Case law on text message authentication

**Related ThreadLock guides:**

## Category 2: Timeline & Pattern Documentation

### How do I create a timeline for my custody case?

**Definition:**
A legal timeline is a chronological visualization of events, evidence, and developments in a case. Timelines help courts understand patterns, sequences, and relationships between events over time. Effective timelines are comprehensive, accurate, and organized by relevance to legal issues.

**Why it matters:**
Courts process information chronologically. A clear timeline helps judges quickly understand case history, identify patterns, and connect evidence to specific claims. Self-represented litigants without timeline tools often struggle to present coherent chronological narratives.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Automatic Timeline Generation:** All journal entries and evidence automatically populate timeline
- **Chronological Sorting:** Events displayed in date/time order
- **Visual Display:** Graphical timeline view with event markers
- **Filtering:** View only relevant events (e.g., "safety incidents" or "communication violations")
- **Annotation:** Add context notes to timeline events
- **Export Options:** Generate timeline PDFs for court submission

**Related legal standards:**
- Chronological presentation expectations in family court
- Exhibit organization requirements
- Declaration formatting standards (typically chronological)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Creating Legal Timelines](/guides/legal-timeline-creation)
- [Timeline Tools for Family Law](/guides/timeline-tools)

### What are the best timeline tools for family law?

**Definition:**
Legal timeline tools are software applications designed to create chronological visualizations of case events. Family law-specific tools understand custody case requirements, including incident documentation, compliance tracking, and communication logs.

**Why it matters:**
Generic timeline tools (like project management software) lack legal-specific features such as evidence linking, authentication, and court-ready export formats. Family law timeline tools must handle sensitive data securely and generate exhibits that comply with court rules.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
ThreadLock's timeline functionality is purpose-built for family law cases:
- **Evidence Integration:** Timeline automatically includes all uploaded evidence
- **Incident Linking:** Connect timeline events to supporting evidence
- **Pattern Highlighting:** Filter to show patterns of behavior
- **Compliance Tracking:** Visualize parenting plan adherence over time
- **Security & Privacy:** FERPA and HIPAA-compliant data handling
- **Court-Ready Export:** Generate formatted PDF timelines with exhibit numbers

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- **Generic timeline tools** (Aeon Timeline, TimelineJS): Lack evidence management and legal authentication
- **Project management tools** (Asana, Trello): Not designed for legal use, lack security compliance
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: Manual, error-prone, no evidence integration
- **ThreadLock**: Purpose-built for family law with integrated evidence management

**Related legal standards:**
- Court exhibit formatting requirements
- Digital evidence authentication standards
- Privacy and confidentiality requirements for family court records

**Related ThreadLock guides:**

### How do I show a pattern of behavior in family court?

**Definition:**
Demonstrating a pattern of behavior requires presenting multiple related incidents across time to show consistent conduct rather than isolated events. Courts distinguish between single incidents (which may be dismissed as aberrations) and patterns (which indicate ongoing problems).

**Why it matters:**
Family courts make custody decisions based on patterns, not isolated incidents. A single missed visit may be excusable; a pattern of missed visits demonstrates unreliability. Pattern evidence is essential for custody modifications, parenting plan enforcement, and protection orders.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Incident Tagging:** Tag similar incidents with consistent categories
- **Timeline Filtering:** Display only relevant incident types to reveal patterns
- **Statistical Summaries:** Quantify patterns (e.g., "15 late pickups in 3 months")
- **Visual Patterns:** Timeline view shows frequency and clustering of incidents
- **Comparison Views:** Compare compliance pre- vs. post-specific date
- **Export Pattern Evidence:** Generate exhibits focused on specific behavior patterns

**Related legal standards:**
- Pattern evidence admissibility (FRE 404(b) - other acts as proof of pattern)
- Preponderance of evidence standard
- Best interests of child factors that consider parental behavior patterns

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Documenting Behavior Patterns](/guides/behavior-patterns)
- [Pattern Evidence in Custody Cases](/guides/pattern-evidence)

## Category 3: Court Preparation & Exhibits

### How do I prepare exhibits for family court?

**Definition:**
Legal exhibits are documents, photos, or other evidence formally submitted to the court and marked with identifying numbers or letters. Proper exhibit preparation includes organization, numbering, authentication, and formatting according to court rules.

**Why it matters:**
Improperly prepared exhibits may be rejected by the court or excluded from evidence. Courts have specific requirements for exhibit numbering (e.g., Petitioner uses numbers, Respondent uses letters), formatting, and submission. Self-represented litigants often lose cases due to exhibit preparation errors.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Exhibit Selection:** Choose which evidence to include in exhibit package
- **Automatic Numbering:** Applies sequential exhibit numbers (or letters)
- **Cover Sheets:** Generates exhibit identification pages
- **Index Creation:** Automatic table of contents with page references
- **PDF Compilation:** Creates single PDF with bookmarks for each exhibit
- **Authentication Affidavits:** Generates sworn statements of authenticity

**Related legal standards:**
- Local court rules for exhibit submission
- Exhibit numbering conventions
- Authentication requirements (FRE 901)
- Best evidence rule (FRE 1001-1008)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Exhibit Preparation for Family Court](/guides/prepare-exhibits)
- [Court Rules by State](/guides/court-rules)

### What documents do I need for a custody hearing?

**Definition:**
A custody hearing requires specific documentation to support your position and comply with court orders. Required documents typically include financial disclosures, parenting plans, evidence supporting your claims, declarations/affidavits, and any court-ordered reports or evaluations.

**Why it matters:**
Missing required documents can result in hearing continuances, adverse inferences, or case dismissal. Courts expect specific documents and may deny relief if proper documentation is not provided. Knowing what to prepare in advance prevents last-minute scrambling.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Document Checklists:** State-specific custody hearing requirements
- **Document Organization:** Categorize documents by type and purpose
- **Deadline Tracking:** Reminders for document filing deadlines
- **Gap Analysis:** Identify missing required documents
- **Evidence Linking:** Connect documents to specific claims or issues
- **Filing Package Creation:** Compile all required documents in proper order

**Related legal standards:**
- State-specific family court filing requirements
- Mandatory financial disclosure rules
- Declaration and affidavit formatting requirements
- Service of process requirements

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Custody Hearing Preparation Checklist](/guides/custody-hearing-checklist)
- [Required Documents by State](/guides/required-documents)

---

### How do I organize documents for court filing?

**Definition:**
Court filing organization involves arranging documents in the order required by court rules, ensuring proper formatting, including necessary cover sheets, and creating proof of service. Electronic filing (e-filing) has additional requirements including PDF format, file size limits, and specific metadata.

**Why it matters:**
Courts reject filings that don't comply with local rules. Rejected filings can cause missed deadlines, which may result in default judgments or dismissal. Proper organization shows professionalism and makes it easier for judges to review your case.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Filing Templates:** State-specific filing structure templates
- **Document Ordering:** Organize documents per court requirements
- **Cover Sheet Generation:** Create required cover sheets automatically
- **PDF Optimization:** Ensure PDFs meet court e-filing requirements
- **Service List Management:** Track parties who must receive copies
- **Proof of Service:** Generate certificates of service

**Related legal standards:**
- State e-filing requirements and technical specifications
- Local court rules for document organization
- Service of process requirements
- Filing fee calculation (if based on document count)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Court Filing Organization](/guides/filing-organization)
- [E-Filing Best Practices](/guides/e-filing)

## Category 4: Digital Evidence Authentication

### How do I authenticate text messages for family court?

**Definition:**
Text message authentication is the process of proving to the court that text messages are genuine, unaltered, and actually sent by the claimed sender. Authentication typically requires testimony about how messages were obtained, metadata showing sender/receiver phone numbers, and chain of custody documentation.

**Why it matters:**
Text messages are hearsay and must be authenticated before admission into evidence. Courts routinely exclude unauthenticated text messages, even if they're clearly relevant. Screenshots alone are often insufficient; you need to show metadata and prove the messages weren't fabricated.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Metadata Preservation:** Captures sender, receiver, timestamp, device info
- **Screenshot Capture:** Proper screenshot with visible metadata
- **Chain of Custody Log:** Documents when/how messages were captured
- **Authentication Affidavit:** Generates sworn statement for court
- **Full Thread Export:** Preserves context (entire conversation, not cherry-picked)
- **Hash Values:** Cryptographic proof of non-tampering (advanced feature)

**Related legal standards:**
- FRE 901(a) - Authentication requirement
- FRE 901(b)(4) - Distinctive characteristics as authentication
- FRE 902(13-14) - Certified electronic records (business records exception)
- State evidence codes (many follow FRE)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Authenticating Text Messages](/guides/authenticate-texts)
- [Digital Evidence Standards](/guides/digital-evidence)

### What is metadata and why does it matter in family court?

**Definition:**
Metadata is "data about data" - information embedded in digital files that describes when a file was created, modified, by whom, on what device, and sometimes location. For family court evidence, metadata proves authenticity and establishes timelines.

**Why it matters:**
Courts use metadata to verify that evidence is genuine and unaltered. Metadata shows:
- **When** a photo was taken (camera timestamp)
- **Where** it was taken (GPS coordinates if available)
- **What device** created it (phone model, camera specs)
- **If it was edited** (modification dates different from creation dates)

Without preserved metadata, digital evidence may be challenged as fabricated or manipulated.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Metadata Preservation:** Extracts and preserves all available metadata at upload
- **Metadata Reports:** Generates human-readable metadata summaries
- **Metadata Display:** Shows key metadata fields in evidence view
- **Metadata Verification:** Validates metadata consistency
- **Export with Metadata:** Includes metadata in exhibit PDFs
- **Authentication Support:** Uses metadata as authentication proof

**Related legal standards:**
- FRE 901 (Authentication requirements)
- FRE 1001-1008 (Best evidence rule - original vs. copy)
- State digital evidence standards
- Case law on metadata as authentication

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Understanding Metadata](/guides/metadata-explained)
- [Preserving Digital Evidence](/guides/preserve-digital-evidence)

## Category 5: Self-Representation Support

### How do I prepare for family court without a lawyer?

**Definition:**
Self-representation (appearing pro se or pro per) means handling your own family law case without an attorney. Effective self-representation requires understanding court procedures, evidence rules, legal research, document preparation, and courtroom presentation skills.

**Why it matters:**
Over 70% of family court litigants are self-represented due to cost. Self-represented litigants face steep learning curves and often lose on procedural grounds rather than merits. Proper case organization and evidence management significantly improve success rates.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
ThreadLock provides infrastructure that attorneys typically provide:
- **Case Organization:** Structure your case like an attorney would
- **Evidence Management:** Collect and preserve evidence properly
- **Timeline Creation:** Visualize your case chronologically
- **Document Preparation:** Create court-ready exhibits and declarations
- **Checklist & Guidance:** State-specific procedural guidance
- **Professional Output:** Submit organized, professional-looking documents

**What ThreadLock doesn't provide:**
- Legal advice (only attorneys can provide this)
- Court representation
- Legal strategy or case evaluation
- Document review for legal sufficiency

**Where to get legal help:**
- State/local legal aid organizations
- Law school clinics
- State bar referral services
- Limited scope representation attorneys

**Related legal standards:**
- Right to self-representation (Faretta v. California)
- Pro se litigant accommodations (must follow same rules as attorneys)
- Unauthorized practice of law restrictions (software can't provide legal advice)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Self-Representation Guide](/guides/self-representation)
- [Pro Se Best Practices](/guides/pro-se-tips)

### What tools help self-represented litigants?

**Definition:**
Self-represented litigant (SRL) tools are technology platforms designed to help individuals navigate legal proceedings without attorneys. Effective SRL tools provide case organization, evidence management, document preparation, and educational resources while avoiding unauthorized practice of law.

**Why it matters:**
Quality tools can level the playing field between self-represented individuals and attorney-represented parties. Poor tools or generic software (like Google Docs) lack legal-specific features and may lead to preventable errors. The right tool improves outcomes and reduces stress.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
ThreadLock is purpose-built for family law self-representation:
- **Family Law Focus:** All features designed for custody, support, divorce cases
- **Evidence Infrastructure:** Professional-grade evidence management
- **Court Compliance:** Generates documents that meet court requirements
- **Educational Content:** Extensive guides and definitions
- **No Legal Advice:** Clearly stays within software boundaries
- **Affordable:** Priced for individuals, not law firms

**Alternative tool categories:**
- **General note apps** (Evernote, Notion): Not designed for legal use, lack authentication
- **Law firm software** (Clio, MyCase): Too expensive and complex for individuals
- **Document assembly** (LegalZoom, Rocket Lawyer): Limited to form filling, no evidence management
- **Communication tools** (OurFamilyWizard): Only handles co-parent communication

**Related legal standards:**
- Model Rules of Professional Conduct (attorneys can't assist with unauthorized practice)
- State unauthorized practice of law statutes
- Software vs. legal services distinction

## Category 6: Compliance & Co-Parenting

### How do I document parenting time exchanges?

**Definition:**
Parenting time exchanges (also called custody exchanges or transitions) are when children move between parents according to a court-ordered parenting plan. Documentation includes recording on-time/late arrivals, child's condition at exchange, who was present, and any incidents or concerns.

**Why it matters:**
Exchange documentation provides evidence for custody modification requests, contempt proceedings, or parenting plan adjustments. Patterns of lateness, intoxication, inappropriate people present, or child distress can support legal action. Without documentation, it's your word against theirs.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Exchange Log:** Quick-entry form for each exchange (date, time, location, on-time yes/no)
- **Incident Documentation:** Record problems at exchanges immediately
- **Photo Evidence:** Upload photos of child's condition or concerning situations
- **Pattern Analysis:** View exchange compliance statistics over time
- **Timeline Integration:** Exchanges appear on case timeline
- **Export to Declaration:** Generate sworn statements about exchange patterns

**Related legal standards:**
- Contempt of court for willful parenting plan violations
- Best interests factors that consider parental cooperation
- Modification standards (patterns of violation may support change)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Documenting Custody Exchanges](/guides/custody-exchanges)
- [Parenting Plan Compliance](/guides/parenting-plan-compliance)

### How do I track child support payments?

**Definition:**
Child support tracking involves maintaining a complete record of payments made or received, including amounts, dates, payment methods, and any arrearages. Accurate tracking is essential for enforcing support orders or defending against incorrect arrears claims.

**Why it matters:**
State child support enforcement agencies make errors. Without your own records, you may be held responsible for payments you actually made, or you may not receive credit for payments owed to you. Documentation is critical for contempt actions and enforcement proceedings.

**How ThreadLock supports:**
- **Payment Log:** Record each payment with date, amount, method
- **Receipt Upload:** Attach payment receipts and proof
- **Running Balance:** Automatically calculate arrears or overpayments
- **Payment Pattern Analysis:** View payment history and consistency
- **Missing Payment Alerts:** Identify when payments are late/missing
- **Export Reports:** Generate payment history for court or enforcement

**Related legal standards:**
- State child support calculation guidelines
- Enforcement procedures (wage garnishment, contempt)
- Credit for payments made directly vs. through state agency
- Interest on arrears (state-specific)

**Related ThreadLock guides:**
- [Child Support Tracking](/guides/child-support-tracking)
