## Notes

1. All dynamic routes share the same component file (e.g., all questions use `resources/q/[slug].tsx`)
2. Styling is checked per route handler, not per individual route
3. Routes marked with ⚠️ Old Styling should be updated to use the new design system
4. Draft items (📝) are included in the registry but may not be fully visible in production
