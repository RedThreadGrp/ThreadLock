# Firebase Environment Variables Configuration - Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. ‚úÖ Dependency Management

- **Removed** `resend` (v1.0.0)
- **Added** `firebase` (v12.4.0)
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### 2. ‚úÖ Firebase Configuration
- **Created** `lib/firebase.js` with Firebase initialization
  - Configured to use both `VITE_` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed environment variables
  - Exports `subscribeLeadFn` callable function for lead subscription
  - Implements singleton pattern for Firebase app initialization

### 3. ‚úÖ Local Development Setup
- **Created** `.env.local` with all Firebase environment variables
  - Includes both `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (Next.js) and `VITE_` prefixes
  - Contains 6 Firebase configuration variables
  - File is gitignored and NOT committed to repository
- **Updated** `.gitignore` to exclude:
  - `.env.local`
  - `.env*.local`

### 4. ‚úÖ Code Migration

#### components/CTA.js
- Removed Supabase client initialization
- Removed `createClient` import from `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Added Firebase import: `subscribeLeadFn` from `../lib/firebase`
- Updated `handleSubmit` to call Firebase Cloud Function instead of Supabase insert

#### pages/api/webhook.js
- Removed Resend email service imports and initialization
- Removed Supabase client initialization
- Removed all Supabase storage bucket logic
- Removed email rendering and sending logic
- Simplified to basic webhook event logging
- **Note:** Email delivery now handled by Firebase Cloud Functions

#### pages/api/env-check.js
- Replaced Supabase environment variable checks with Firebase checks
- Now checks for `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- Supports both `VITE_` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes

#### pages/api/supa-ping.js
- Converted from Supabase connectivity test to Firebase test
- Removed Supabase database operations
- Now returns Firebase configuration status
- **Note:** Will need Firebase Cloud Function deployed to fully test

### 5. ‚úÖ Vercel Deployment Documentation
- **Created** `VERCEL_SETUP.md` with complete instructions for:
  - Linking to Vercel project `threadlock-ai`
  - Adding 13 environment variables (FIREBASE_TOKEN + 6 VITE_* + 6 NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
  - Verifying environment variable setup
  - Triggering production deployment
  - Post-deployment testing procedures

### 6. ‚úÖ Build Verification
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successful
- **Output:** 14 static pages, 5 API routes
- No compilation errors
- All imports resolved correctly

### 7. ‚úÖ Security Verification
- **CodeQL Scan:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Result:** 0 security alerts found
- No Supabase/Resend references remaining in codebase

## üìã Action Items for Deployment

Since this is a sandboxed environment without Vercel credentials, the following steps must be performed manually:

### Required: Vercel Environment Variable Setup

Execute these commands from your local machine where you have Vercel credentials:

1. **Link to project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ThreadLock
   vercel link --project threadlock-ai --confirm
   ```

2. **Add environment variables:**
   
   Follow the complete instructions in `VERCEL_SETUP.md` to add all 13 environment variables:
   - 1 FIREBASE_TOKEN
   - 6 VITE_FIREBASE_* variables
   - 6 NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* variables

3. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   vercel env ls
   ```

4. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod --confirm
   ```

### Required: Firebase Cloud Function Deployment

The marketing site now expects a Firebase Cloud Function named `subscribeLead` to exist. This function should:

1. Accept parameters: `{ fullName: string, email: string }`
2. Create a document in Firestore `leads/{lead_id}` collection
3. Optionally create/update document in `users/{user_id}` collection
4. Handle any email notifications (replacing Resend functionality)

**Reference the app-web repository** for the existing `subscribeLead` function implementation that should be reused.

## üîç Testing Checklist

After deploying to Vercel and ensuring Firebase Cloud Function is deployed:

- [ ] Visit https://threadlock.ai
- [ ] Navigate to signup form (CTA section)
- [ ] Enter test name and email
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Verify redirect to Stripe Checkout
- [ ] Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí `leads` collection for new document
- [ ] Check browser console for any Firebase errors
- [ ] Test `/api/env-check` endpoint returns Firebase vars as `true`

## üìä Status Report

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Firebase environment variables configured locally (.env.local)
2. Supabase/Resend dependencies removed
3. Firebase SDK installed and configured
4. All code updated to use Firebase
5. Build succeeds without errors
6. Security scan passed (CodeQL)
7. Vercel setup instructions documented

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending (User Action Required)
1. Run Vercel CLI commands to add environment variables to production
2. Deploy Firebase Cloud Function `subscribeLead`
3. Trigger Vercel production deployment
4. Verify end-to-end functionality on live site

## üîê Security Notes

- All Firebase credentials are stored in environment variables
- `.env.local` is properly gitignored and NOT in repository
- No secrets hardcoded in source code
- Firebase API key is intentionally public (client-side safe)
- CodeQL scan found 0 security vulnerabilities

## üìù Additional Notes

### Environment Variable Naming
The codebase supports both naming conventions:
- `VITE_*` prefix (Vite convention)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix (Next.js convention)

This ensures compatibility regardless of which prefix Vercel uses.

### Backward Compatibility
The webhook.js simplification means:
- Email delivery must be handled by Firebase Cloud Functions
- File downloads must be handled separately
- Stripe events are still verified and logged

### Future Enhancements
Consider implementing:
- Error handling for failed Firebase function calls
- Retry logic for Firebase operations
- Analytics tracking for lead submissions
- Email confirmation flow via Firebase
