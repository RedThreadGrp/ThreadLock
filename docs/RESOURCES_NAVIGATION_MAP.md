## Key Fix: proof-of-service-definition Route

### Problem
PR 66 created a static route at `/resources/qa/proof-of-service.tsx` but the system expected the dynamic route `/resources/q/proof-of-service-definition` to work.

### Solution
1. Removed the unused static file: `pages/resources/qa/proof-of-service.tsx`
2. Updated all references in `ResourcesPage.tsx` to use `/resources/q/proof-of-service-definition`
3. The dynamic route at `pages/resources/q/[slug].tsx` now properly handles this content
4. Updated sitemap generator to include all question routes

### Route Now Works
- ✓ URL: `/resources/q/proof-of-service-definition`
- ✓ Title: "What Counts as Proof of Service? | ThreadLock"
- ✓ Content: Properly rendered from `resourcesRegistry.ts`
- ✓ Schema: FAQPage schema included for SEO
- ✓ Navigation: Links to related questions and resources
- ✓ Sitemap: Included in sitemap.xml

## Testing

All routes can be tested via:
- Direct navigation: `curl http://localhost:3000/resources/q/proof-of-service-definition`
- E2E tests: `npm run e2e -- --spec cypress/e2e/resources_hub.cy.ts`
- Sitemap validation: Check `public/sitemap.xml`

## Maintenance

When adding new content:
1. Add to `src/content/resourcesRegistry.ts`
2. Run `npm run generate-sitemap` to update sitemap
3. Test the route works locally
4. Run E2E tests to ensure no regressions
