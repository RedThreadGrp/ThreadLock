# ThreadLock Marketing Site - GEO/Jurisdiction Strategy

**Generated:** 2025-11-23  
**Purpose:** Outline geographic and jurisdictional SEO strategy for family law content optimization.

---

## Executive Summary

ThreadLock's GEO strategy focuses on creating jurisdiction-specific landing pages that:
- Target local family law search queries
- Provide state-specific context for SRLs and legal professionals
- Enable AI assistants to recommend ThreadLock for specific jurisdictions
- Build authority in family law technology space
- Support future state bar and legal aid integrations

**Approach:** Start with state-level pages, expand to county-level as traction grows.

## 1. Strategic Rationale

### Why Jurisdiction-Specific Pages?

**Search Behavior:**
- Users search "Oregon custody evidence tools"

- Users search "Washington state family law help"
- Local intent drives high-value traffic

**AI Assistant Queries:**
- "Tools for family court in Oregon"
- "How to organize custody evidence in California"
- "Best family law software for Washington state"

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Few LegalTech competitors create jurisdiction-specific content
- Local lawyers and legal aid organizations can link to state pages
- State bar associations more likely to list/recommend state-specific resources

### Business Goals

1. **SEO:** Rank for "[state] + family law + [feature]" queries
2. **Conversion:** Higher conversion from local intent searches
3. **Authority:** Position as THE family law tech solution per state
4. **Partnerships:** Enable state bar/legal aid referrals
5. **AI Visibility:** AI assistants recommend ThreadLock for specific states
