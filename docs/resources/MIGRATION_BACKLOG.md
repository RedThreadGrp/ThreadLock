## Triage Rules

**Simple**: v1 has clear headings or bullet structure; under 1200 words.

**Medium**: mixed structure; 1200–2500 words.

**Hard**: tangled formatting, multiple "Short Answer" blocks, tables, or state-by-state lists; or over 2500 words.

**Minimal**: Under 100 words; needs content expansion before migration.

**Content Creation**: Topic hubs need 250-500 word intro + curated links, not migration.
