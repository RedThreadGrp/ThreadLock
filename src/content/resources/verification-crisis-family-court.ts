      "Family courts face an unprecedented verification crisis as AI-generated citations, fabricated case law, and unverifiable digital evidence undermine judicial trust. Without structural safeguards for citation authentication and digital provenance, self-represented litigants and attorneys alike can inadvertently submit plausible legal fiction. This article examines the verification bottleneck and proposes Evidence Passport standards for trusted digital submissions.",
