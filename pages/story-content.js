      "I walked into family court with a law degree and what I thought was a secret weapon: confidence. <strong>I was wrong.</strong>",
      "Almost immediately, I was drowning. The sheer volume of information was a chaotic flood of every text, email, document, and date. The system was not just complex; it felt designed to be bewildering. My confidence evaporated, replaced by the same fear and powerlessness that millions of people feel every year.",
      "But the moment that changed everything was not a ruling or a legal argument. It was when I learned about the judge in my case.",
      "Before putting on the robe, this judge had built a career working with underserved populations and minorities. They were a known advocate for access to justice, a champion for the underdog. For a moment, I felt a surge of hope. Here was someone who understood the struggle.",
      "Yet, from the bench, that same person was entirely unable to provide the access they once for. The clarity and support I needed were not there. The system’s rigid, overwhelming process held them back as much as it held me.",
      "In that moment, I could have chosen to be angry. I could have assumed laziness or bias. But looking at the situation, I saw something else: <strong>a good person constrained by a bad system.</strong>",
      "The only reason a former champion of the underdog becomes the hand of an unfeeling system is a lack of an alternative.",
      "The problem was not the judge. The problem was not even a lack of good intentions. It was a crisis of information. The system is a product of itself, self perpetuating because it lacks the tools to allow for anything different. It forces everyone, including litigants, lawyers, and even judges, to work within its broken framework.",
      "And that’s when I realized the most important thing: <strong>this is a solvable problem.</strong>"
